DISCLAIMER
This extension was written many years ago as fun and now its not work (or may be not work as it has to be). 

Anyway, I know that GitHub is full of bright talents who wants to make it work, so - go ahead. I can support you, but only by words, not by new code.

So if you want to help - create fork and do commit. Any other issues will be closed as irrelevant.

Thank you and take care of yourself and your family! v
